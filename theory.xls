In contrast, punishment (both positive and negative) decreases the likelihood that the antecedent behavior will happen again. Positive indicates the application of a stimulus; Negative indicates the withholding of a stimulus. Learning is therefore defined as a change in behavior in the learner.

However, simply adding words to pictures is not an effective way to achieve multimedia learning. The goal is to instructional media in the light of how human mind works. This is the basis for Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning. This theory proposes three main assumptions when it comes to learning with multimedia: 1. There are two separate channels (auditory and visual) for processing information (sometimes referred to as Dual-Coding theory);
2. Each channel has a limited (finite) capacity (similar to Sweller's notion of Cognitive Load);
3. Learning is an active process of filtering, selecting, organizing, and integrating information based upon prior knowledge.</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>Humans can only process a finite amount of information in a channel at a time, and they make sense of incoming information by actively creating mental representations. Mayer also discusses the role of three memory stores: sensory (which receives stimuli and stores it for a very short time), working (where we actively process information to create mental constructs (or 'schema'), and long-term (the repository of all things learned). Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning presents the idea that the brain does not interpret a multimedia presentation of words, pictures, and auditory information in a mutually exclusive fashion; rather, these elements are selected and organized dynamically to produce logical mental constructs. Futhermore, Mayer underscores the importance of learning (based upon the testing of content and demonstrating the successful transfer of knowledge) when new information is integrated with prior knowledge.</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>Richard E.

Individuals compare their behaviors with those of others and make value judgments about their own and othersâ€™ behaviors. In this way, according to social-cognitive theory, it is not simply the external conditions alone that determine behavior (as extreme behaviorists might claim), but it is also the decisions one makes based on one's cognitions (â€œknowledgeâ€ù) about the conditions. Bandura's theory includes several key concepts concerning the development of personal and social behaviors, among which are reciprocal determination - the idea that the person's behavior and the social learning environment continually influence each other in reciprocal ways&quot;

Third, specific coding elements can save the learner from difficult mental elaborations by overtly supplanting or short-circuiting specific elaboration. Fourth, symbol systems differ with respect to how much processing they demand or allow. Fifth, symbol systems differ with respect to the kinds of mental processes they call on for recoding and elaboration. Thus, symbol systems partly determine who will acquire how much knowledge from what kinds of messages&quot; (pp.226-227).</td><td class=xl2216681 nowrap>G.
